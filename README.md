# Temperature-Forecasting-Using-ARIMA
Welcome to the Temperature Forecasting Using ARIMA project! In this project, we have developed a Python-based ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model to predict temperature trends. Through rigorous experimentation and data analysis, we have achieved remarkable accuracy and reliability in temperature forecasting.

Project Overview

Dates: September 2021 - November 2021
Location: Boston, MA
Technologies Used: Python, ARIMA, Deep Learning, Dickey-Fuller Test, EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
About the Project

Accurate temperature forecasting is crucial for various industries and applications, including agriculture, energy management, and climate research. This project addresses the challenge of temperature prediction by leveraging the power of ARIMA models and advanced data analysis techniques.

Key Achievements

High Accuracy: We initiated the development of a Python-based ARIMA model for temperature trend prediction, achieving a remarkable Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 2.32. This low RMSE value signifies the model's high accuracy in forecasting temperature trends, reducing the average error to 5.1%.
Model Selection: To ensure the best model performance, we experimented with various ARIMA models and compared their performance using log-likelihood. This rigorous model selection process helped us identify and deploy the most accurate model for temperature forecasting.
Data Stationarity: We utilized the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test to ensure the stationarity of the temperature data. Stationarity is a crucial prerequisite for time series analysis, and this step ensures the reliability of our forecasts.
